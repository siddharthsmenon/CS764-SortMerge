Points

1. Patitioner Init:   
    Both R and S (tin and tout)
    PageCursor starting for both a,b
    iterate through full and get offsets for each thread (based on equal partition).
    split function call with the 2 PageCursors

2. Compute function for each thread (gets the pagecursors for R, S, S-TableRoot):
     Sort S  
         iterate through tuples 
         create a list of join keys
         create map of key->tuple address
         sort (list)
         In place page construction
     barrier()
     Copy and Sort R
         Iterate through tuples 
         create a list of join keys
         create map of key->tuple address
         sort (list)
         reconstruct pages (use setnext, pagebuffer initialization)
         reconstruct pagecursor
     Merge with S
         make copy of S pagecursor
         Iterate R and Iterate S
         Output
